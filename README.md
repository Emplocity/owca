# OWCA - Optimized and Well-Translated Customization of Alpaca

The OWCA dataset is a Polish-translated dataset of instructions for fine-tuning the Alpaca model made by Stanford.

## OWCA Dataset

The OWCA dataset is a customized and well-translated dataset of instructions for fine-tuning the Alpaca model made by Stanford. The Alpaca model is a state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) model that can be fine-tuned on various tasks such as sentiment analysis, text classification, and question answering.

## Purpose of the Dataset

The OWCA dataset was created to provide a high-quality Polish-translated version of instructions for fine-tuning the Alpaca model. It aims to help researchers and data scientists who are interested in utilizing the Alpaca model for NLP tasks in the Polish language.

## Data Source

The OWCA dataset was created by translating the original instructions for fine-tuning the Alpaca model into Polish. The original cleaned instructions were made by cleaning the original Stanford instructions and can be found [here](https://github.com/gururise/AlpacaDataCleaned). The translation was done algorithmically generated from various sources. It is ongoing proofreading is taking place by a team of experienced translators and NLP experts to ensure the accuracy and quality of the dataset.

#DONE proofread
#TODO add more instructions
## Contents of the Dataset

The dataset is provided in a text format and can be easily integrated into NLP projects that require fine-tuning of the Alpaca model for Polish language tasks. 


Optimized - Dataset is being transformed into more relevant for polish use : law, metrics  etc.

Well-Translated - translated and ongoing proofreading is taking place 

Customization - output differs from original Alpaca and often contains deeper and broader explanations of output, especially code 

## Potential Uses of the Dataset

The OWCA dataset can be used by researchers and data scientists who are working on NLP tasks in the Polish language. It can be particularly useful for those who are interested in utilizing the Alpaca model, which is a state-of-the-art NLP model that has shown impressive performance in various tasks. The dataset can also serve as a valuable resource for those who are interested in studying the process of fine-tuning NLP models.
